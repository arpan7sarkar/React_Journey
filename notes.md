alway write your react code inside fragements <></> .
eskunt.config.js is used to write the rules that developer needs to follow
in react we write className not classes and while defining component we name them using Uppercase format
In react we follow component based architecutre
for using scss only change the name of css file to scss
for using js in react we have to write the var name inside {}

props:
we can get data from upper hirerchial parents
app->nav here we can use properties of app in nav but not navs attribute into app
for passing numbers inside props we need to write the num inside {}

### props recives a object inside it and similer to backend for getting the values from pops we have to use props.value method calling
//
ex: const name= props.name

we can get any type of icon we want from lucid-react
for using plain css in a better way for react we use module css:
so what is module css? 
for using modulo css we have to create a folder then their we have to give our component and the css that we want to use into the component in single folder then have to link using import style form ./blahblah.css

          typeChange(e);
        }}
